# Front-end Tools
So I don't want to talk just about myself but I wanted to let you all know about some tools that have my life easier and way more productive.


# EditorConfig

* Working in a team

## Examples

* Intendation (Spaces/Tabs)
* Encoding
* Trailing whitespace

## Conclusion

* No way to enforce that - until recently
* Used by jQuery/Modernizr


# LiveReload

monitors changes in the file system.
As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser is refreshed.

## Examples

* Change background
* Change instatag

## Conclusion

* Huge timesaver
* Next version:
  * In the browser
  * Paul Rouget - Live editing - http://paulrouget.com/e/devtoolsnext/

# Grunt

* Build system
  * Minify
  * Hash
  * Image minification
  * Javascript Tests
  * Linting
* Completely written in JavaScript
* Used by jQuery/Modernizr

## Examples

* grunt uglify
* grunt jshint
* grunt

## Conclusion

* Great build tool


# Sublime Text

## Examples

* Command+T
* GitGutter
* Live linting
* Trailing spaces


# DotFiles

* As a JavaScript/HTML/CSS person you'll probably interact with the console a lot
* Dotfiles are a combination of files that make your terminal rock

## Examples

* `..`
* p
* git info
* emptytrash
* mkd
* z cal
* z showoff
