# Outline

## Intro

It's great to be here tonight and it's truly an honor to speak in front of all of you. Thank you so much Vanessa and Peter for inviting me.

So you might be wondering, who's this guy giving the presentation tonight.
Well, I'm a front-end developer and I've been coding for the web since I was 12 years old.
I've been in the States for about 4.5 years and I acutally still remember meeting Peter & Vanessa during my second week here.
And as some of your instructors might know, in my free time, I love to go for a sail in the Bay.

You can find me on twitter at @christianvuer and I'll be posting the slides after this presentation.

 - Lint tools - sass-lint / scss-lint / stylehint
 - SVG's instead of PNG's / icon fonts
 -

CSS Layout
 - Flex / Grid / Columns

CSS Variables
 - Slowly moving away from SASS / LESS
 - Very much like CoffeeScript & ES 2016/2017

How can we use some of these today?
