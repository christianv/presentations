Build tool


Grunt / Gulp

Compile: SASS / CoffeeScript
Optimize images

http://slid.es/contra/gulp
Grunt vs. Gulp
Plugins do multiple things
  Want a banner? Use the javascript minifier
  Uglify - both minify & rename
Headache of temp files/folders due to bad flow control

http://travismaynard.com/writing/no-need-to-grunt-take-a-gulp-of-fresh-air
With Gulp your build file is code, not config
  gulp follows the CommonJS spec,
You use standard libraries to do things
Plugins are simple and do one thing - most are a ~20 line function
Tasks are executed with maximum concurrency
I/O works the way you picture it
